This example creates an authentication system that uses **an encrypted storage to store session data**.
 
- Firebase Authentication with Email Passwordless Link is used to authenticate users.
- Session data is encrypted in local storage.

**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the apps through the [Expo Publish Link](https://exp.host/@jglchen/firebase-auth-email) with [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app.
