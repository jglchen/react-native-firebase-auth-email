# React Native Firebase Passwordless Authentication

This example creates an authentication system that uses **an encrypted storage to store session data**.
 
- Firebase Authentication with Email Passwordless Link is used to authenticate users.
- Session data is encrypted in local storage.


**iOS** and **Android** mobile apps are developed with **React Native**, anyone who is interested can test the development builds with [iOS Simulator Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth-email/builds/0f15f092-b8d8-4bc1-ac03-bf703c0d3edd) and [Android Internal Distribution Build](https://expo.dev/accounts/jglchen/projects/firebase-auth-email/builds/fb497610-636a-48ef-8686-725e40d19ed1).
